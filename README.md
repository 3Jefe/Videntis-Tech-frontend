# Videntis — AI-Powered Investment Trend & Automation Platform

**Videntis is my concept for an AI-driven investment intelligence platform built to detect upcoming market trends, analyse investor behaviour, and automate smart investment strategies based on user risk profiles.**

The goal is simple:

### **Make intelligent investing accessible to everyone — not just people with time, experience, or institutional resources.**

---

## 🚀 Vision

Most investing tools show you *what has already happened*.  
Videntis focuses on what’s **about to happen** by analysing:

- Institutional investor trends  
- Historical market cycles  
- Momentum patterns  
- Sector rotations  
- Sentiment & volatility  
- Emerging asset-class behaviour  

This allows the algorithm to highlight rising opportunities **before they become mainstream**, helping users stay ahead of market movements like top investors do.

## 🎯 What Videntis Does (Concept Summary)

### ✔️ **AI Trend Detection**  
Models analyse historical data, momentum signals, volume anomalies, macro shifts and institutional flow.

### ✔️ **Personalised Investment Profiles**  
Users select:

- Risk tolerance  
- Sectors of interest  
- Time horizon  
- Automation frequency  

Videntis adjusts exposure accordingly.

### ✔️ **Automated Investing (Optional)**  
Set:  
- daily  
- hourly  
- or monthly investing  

Videntis deploys capital into your chosen strategies based on trend strength & risk scoring (conceptual).

### ✔️ **Behaviour-Based Portfolio Adjustments**  
The system learns from user preferences and historical outcomes to refine future allocations.

## 🧠 High-Level Architecture (Concept)

This is a simplified version of how Videntis would operate:

### **1. Data Layer**
- Market data (stocks, crypto, ETFs)  
- Investor sentiment  
- Macro indicators  
- Social signals & volume patterns  

### **2. AI Trend Engine**
- LSTM models for cycle prediction  
- Gradient boosting for trend scoring  
- Clustering for investor-style matching  

### **3. Decision Layer**
- Allocates weightings based on risk  
- Identifies early trend strength  
- Auto-adjusts investment cadence  

### **4. User Profile Layer**
- Tracks performance  
- Adjusts recommendations  
- Provides insights & alerts

## 📈 Example Outputs (Concept)

- “AI & Robotics: Momentum Score 84% — early accumulation phase detected.”  
- “Reduce tech exposure due to volatility spike (+13% VIX).”  
- “Increase Clean Energy allocation based on macro rotation.”  

These outputs would fuel personalised dashboards and automated strategies.

## 🏗 Current Stage (MVP Design)

This repository focuses on the **product and intelligence architecture**, including:

- Data model design  
- Trend-prediction concept  
- Technical vision  
- Feature strategy  
- Roadmap  
- Investment automation logic (conceptual)  

It’s intentionally minimal, showcasing **how I think about designing technical products, data systems, and future-facing financial tools**.

## 🔮 Roadmap

### **Phase 1 — Data & Trend Engine**
- Build the trend scoring pipeline  
- Develop early prediction signals

### **Phase 2 — User Profiles & Personalisation**
- Risk-based strategy builder  
- Sector weighting logic  

### **Phase 3 — Investment Automation**
- Auto-invest scheduling (hourly/daily/monthly)  
- Auto-rebalance based on trend decay  

### **Phase 4 — Community Insights**
- “Follow top investor profiles”  
- Copy-strategy marketplace  

### **Phase 5 — Expansion Layer**
- Multi-asset support  
- Partnerships  
- Institutional-grade dashboards

## 💬 Why I Built This Concept

I want to design products that combine:

- **data science**  
- **automation**  
- **behavioural finance**  
- **AI-driven insights**  
- **real business value**  

Videntis represents how I think about technology:  
**practical, intelligent, and built to genuinely improve people’s financial lives.**

This isn't a full app yet — it’s the foundation of a much bigger vision.
