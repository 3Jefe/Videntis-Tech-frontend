▶️ Running the Demo

• portfolio tilts based on personality
• explanation of how each investor sees the market
• a complete text-based investment strategy output

🧠 Future Expansion

Planned upgrades for the next version of Videntis include:
• live financial data connections
• news + sentiment weighting via trusted sources
• real machine learning forecasting
• volatility and macro regime detection
• a visual dashboard with charts
• automated recurring investment options
• user-created investor profiles

⭐ Why This Prototype Stands Out

Videntis demonstrates:
• strong product architecture
• knowledge of investment logic
• modular AI-ready design
• professional communication of technical ideas
• a system that can realistically grow into a full fintech platform

It positions you as someone capable of thinking like a:
future founder, technical strategist, and investment innovator.
